# A small land use classification

What is Machine Learning ? Can it classify urban area ?

Using a simple RF Model over Google Maps Imagery that have been scrapped, this repo aimed at showing intuitively the power of Machine Learning and limitation. 

# Limitations

The misclassification of certain areas is due to several factors, some are simple to imagine:
- The model is too simplistic
- There are too few images
- The noise of images can be difficult to overcome

But some are really difficult with Machine Learning:
- What is an urbanized area ? 
- Is a small park in a city an urbanized or non-urbanized area ?
